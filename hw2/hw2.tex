\section{Write Up}
\begin{enumerate}
                \item What do you think the main point of this assignment is? \\
The main point of this assignment is to learn how to work with the disk scheduler, or I/O scheduler, on the kernel. Using the current I/O schedulers as base algorithms to work off of, we will build a LOOK or CLOOK algorithm on the NOOP scheduler. 
                \item How did you personally approach the problem? Design decisions, algorithm, etc. \\
This assignment took a lot of research ahead of time before actually sitting down to work on the code. 
First off, we needed to understand what the current algorithm was doing. 
NOOP is essentially a first-come-first-served (FCFS) or FIFO algorithm, meaning whatever request it receives first is the first one it is going to process. 
Additionally, it does not do any sorting. It does sort a new request with adjacent requests. 

LOOK or CLOOK algorithm description here -- depending on which one we choose. 

To implement our selected algorithm, we made use of the Kernel's Linked List implementation. 
                \item How did you ensure your solution was correct? Testing details, for instance.
                \item What did you learn?
                \item How should the TA evaluate your work? Provide detailed steps to prove correctness 
\end{enumerate}
