\section{Design Plan}
Our plan began with researching how the current SLOB layer works within the Linux Kernel. 
The current algorithm that is used is the first fit.
This algorithm finds the first page that has sufficient space to fit the current request and allocates that memory for it. 

We want to change this algorithm to the best fit algorithm, which will cycle through the available pages and allocate the page that best fits the request. 

Our first step is to view the current implementation in the \textit{mm/slob.c} file. 
After some research, we found two websites that offer more explanation: \url{http://classes.engr.oregonstate.edu/eecs/fall2011/cs411/proj02.pdf} and 
\url{https://courses.engr.illinois.edu/cs423/sp2011/mps/mp4/mp4.pdf}.

The first thing these sources helped us learn was how to enable the SLOB allocator. 

	\begin{enumerate}
		\item Replace CONFIG\_EMBEDDED to CONFIG\_EMBEDDED=y in the .config file
		\item Run the command "make menuconfig"
		\item Go to General Setup - Choose SLAB Allocator and choose SLOB
	\end{enumerate}

Next, we will create a program to compute the efficiency of both algorithms and compare the fragmentation. 
To do this, we will use system calls. 

Next we will examine the \textit{slob\_alloc()} and \textit{slob\_page\_alloc()} functions and implement the best fit algorithm within these two functions.
